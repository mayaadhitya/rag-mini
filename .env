Dear xAI Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the AI Tutor (Full-Time, Remote) position at xAI. With a solid foundation in machine learning, hands-on experience in real-world AI projects, and a deep commitment to innovation and clarity in communication, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to xAI’s mission of building AI systems that can understand and reason about the universe.
I bring a blend of technical proficiency and real-world project experience. My notable projects—such as a real-time speech translation system and a RAG-powered PDF analyzer—required not only building advanced pipelines but also crafting high-quality input data, aligning closely with the goals of the AI Tutor role.

In addition:

I interned at Accenture, where I contributed to automation and data integration tasks, honing skills in data curation and quality control.

I have strong research and communication abilities developed through content creation, mentoring, and 2+ years of leadership experience at NxtWave.

I’m proficient in English and have basic knowledge of German, with a growing interest in multilingual AI applications.

My skill set includes Python, REST APIs, FastAPI, and ML tools such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers—technologies relevant for interacting with LLMs and refining their outputs.

I’m particularly drawn to xAI's culture of excellence, flat structure, and mission-driven focus. The opportunity to directly support AI model alignment and training—through structured annotation, data labeling, and content evaluation—deeply excites me. I am fully comfortable working with text, voice, and video, and I have the required hardware and schedule flexibility for remote collaboration in global teams.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be thrilled to support xAI's efforts toward responsible and intelligent AI systems and contribute to your breakthroughs in knowledge and reasoning.

Warm regards,
Adhitya
